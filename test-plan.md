# GroundSchool AI Testing Plan

## Unit Testing

### Component Tests
- **UI Components**: Test all UI components (ThemedButton, ThemedCard, ThemedInput, LoadingIndicator)
  - Verify rendering with different props
  - Test interaction behaviors (press, focus, etc.)
  - Validate accessibility features
  - Test different visual states (loading, error, disabled)

### Service Tests
- **Authentication Services**: Test login, signup, and token management
- **Document Services**: Test document creation, retrieval, and processing
- **Quiz Services**: Test quiz generation, submission, and scoring
- **Offline Services**: Test queue management and synchronization
- **Error Handling**: Test error capture, formatting, and reporting

## Integration Testing

### Navigation Flows
- Test authentication flow (login → home)
- Test document management flow (upload → preview → quiz)
- Test quiz taking flow (start → answer → results)
- Test offline mode transitions

### Context Integration
- Test AuthContext with navigation and protected routes
- Test ThemeContext with component theming
- Test offline context with service operations

## End-to-End Testing

### Critical User Journeys
1. **New User Onboarding**:
   - Sign up → Profile completion → Document upload
2. **Quiz Creation and Taking**:
   - Document upload → Quiz generation → Quiz taking → Results review
3. **Analytics Review**:
   - Multiple quiz completions → Analytics dashboard → Performance review

### Offline Functionality
- Test complete offline operation:
  - Document caching
  - Quiz taking while offline
  - Synchronization when back online

## Performance Testing

- **Load Time**: Measure initial load time and navigation transitions
- **Memory Usage**: Monitor memory usage during extended sessions
- **Battery Impact**: Measure battery consumption during typical usage

## Accessibility Testing

- Screen reader compatibility
- Keyboard navigation
- Color contrast compliance
- Touch target sizing

## Security Testing

- Authentication token handling
- Data encryption
- Input validation and sanitization
- API request validation

## Implementation Plan

1. **Fix Existing Tests**:
   - Update test imports
   - Fix accessibility testing methods
   - Align expectations with implementation

2. **Increase Test Coverage**:
   - Add tests for uncovered components
   - Enhance service test coverage
   - Add integration tests for key flows

3. **Automate Critical Tests**:
   - Set up CI/CD pipeline
   - Configure automated test runs
   - Implement reporting and notifications

4. **Monitor and Iterate**:
   - Track test metrics over time
   - Address regressions quickly
   - Expand test coverage based on user feedback
