## Introduction

GroundSchool AI is a mobile and web application designed to help aviation students prepare for exams by generating SACAA-style multiple-choice questions based on their study materials. The app uses AI to create relevant, context-specific questions that help students test their knowledge and identify areas for improvement.

### Problem Statement

Aviation students face challenges in effectively preparing for exams:
- Expensive commercial study apps that charge per exam or subject
- Limited access to practice questions specific to their study materials
- Generic practice tests that don't target their specific learning needs
- Difficulty in identifying knowledge gaps in complex aviation subjects
- Time-consuming process of creating self-test questions

### Solution

GroundSchool AI addresses these challenges by providing a cost-effective alternative that:
- Allows students to upload their own study materials (PDF or Images) for free
- Uses AI to generate relevant, SACAA-style multiple-choice questions
- Provides immediate feedback on answers
- Tracks progress over time to identify areas for improvement
- Offers offline access to previously generated quizzes

## Product Overview

### Core Features

1. **Cost-Effective Learning**: Generate unlimited practice questions from your own materials for a fraction of the cost of commercial apps
2. **Document Upload**: Upload PDF or Images study materials for analysis
3. **AI-Generated Questions**: Create SACAA-style multiple-choice questions based on uploaded content
4. **Quiz Taking**: Answer questions with immediate feedback
5. **Progress Tracking**: View quiz history and performance analytics
6. **Offline Support**: Access previously generated quizzes without internet connection
7. **Progressive Web App (PWA)**: 
   - Available on iOS, Android, and Web
   - Enables easy user testing via a single web link
   - Free access during user testing phase
   - Seamless transition to native apps when ready

### Value Proposition

GroundSchool AI transforms passive reading into active learning by generating targeted questions from students' own study materials, helping them identify knowledge gaps and improve retention through active recall - all at a fraction of the cost of traditional study apps. The PWA approach allows for easy user testing and feedback collection before full native app release.
